    a. Validation for the players number, so it:
        i. does not allow to enter any number out of the possible number rage of the computerâ€™s number;
        ii. does not allow to enter any non-numeric characters;
        iii. asks you to repeat entering the valid number in range if any of the non-valid characters are entered.
    b. EXTRA (optional): Create game difficulty levels:
        i. 1, 3 range is the easy mode;
        ii. 1, 5 range is the medium mode;
        iii. 1, 10 range is the hard mode;
        iv. Allow the user to choose the difficulty before he starts the new round of the game
